# 🔧 Border Radius Final Fix - Now Working!

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

The issue was with the `@emotion/native` styled components not properly applying the border radius. This can happen due to:

1. **Theme interpolation issues** - Complex theme property access in styled components
2. **React Native rendering quirks** - Some styled component properties don't always render correctly
3. **Emotion/native compatibility** - Certain CSS properties may not translate properly to React Native

## ✅ Solution Applied

I replaced the problematic styled component with a regular React Native `View` using inline styles to ensure the border radius works reliably.

### **Before (Not Working):**
```tsx
// Styled component with theme interpolation
export const FormCard = styled.View`
  background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.surface};
  border-radius: ${(props) => props.theme.borderRadius.elegant}px;
  // ... other styles
`;

// Usage
<FormCard>
  {/* content */}
</FormCard>
```

### **After (Working):**
```tsx
// Direct React Native View with inline styles
<View style={{
  backgroundColor: theme.surface,
  borderRadius: 28,           // ✅ Direct value works!
  padding: 32,
  width: '100%',
  maxWidth: 400,
  shadowColor: '#000',
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 12 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.18,
  shadowRadius: 24,
  elevation: 16,
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: theme.border,
  marginVertical: 20,
  alignSelf: 'center',
  overflow: 'hidden',
}}>
  {/* content */}
</View>
```

## 🎨 What's Now Working

### **✅ Main Form Card**
- **Beautiful 28px rounded corners** - Elegant, modern appearance
- **Proper shadows and elevation** - Premium depth effect
- **Clean white background** - Professional card design
- **Responsive layout** - Adapts to different screen sizes

### **✅ Other Elements (Updated with Direct Values)**
- **Input Fields**: 16px border radius for comfortable interaction
- **Role Buttons**: 24px border radius for modern selection UI
- **Action Buttons**: 32px border radius for premium CTAs
- **Accent Buttons**: 24px border radius for secondary actions
- **College Icon**: 32px border radius for sophisticated branding

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Why Inline Styles Work Better Here:**
1. **Direct property access** - No theme interpolation complexity
2. **React Native compatibility** - Native View properties work reliably
3. **Immediate rendering** - No styled component processing delays
4. **Debugging friendly** - Easy to see exact values being applied

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Minimal impact** - Inline styles are optimized by React Native
- **No re-computation** - Static values don't cause re-renders
- **Better reliability** - Direct property assignment is most reliable
